The purpose of this study is to develop a reliable and accurate plant disease recognition model that can be easily implemented in practice. The methodology used in this study involves gathering images of plant leaves, assessed by agricultural experts, and using them to train a deep CNN using Tensor Flow. The CNN consists of multiple layers of receptive fields, which process portions of the input image, and tiling is used to tolerate translation of the input image. Local or global pooling layers combine the outputs of neuron clusters, and various combinations of convolutional and fully connected layers are used with point wise nonlinearity applied at the end of each layer.

The dataset used in this study was taken from Kaggle and consisted of images of plant leaves from the PlantVillage dataset. Image preprocessing was performed to enhance data by removing low-frequency background noise, normalizing the intensity of the individual particles images, removing reflections, and masking portions of images. Agricultural experts examined leaf images and labeled all the images with appropriate disease acronyms to ensure accurate classification of images for the training and validation dataset.

The deep convolutional neural network was trained using Tensor Flow, an open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. The flexible architecture of Tensor Flow allows deployment of computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. Tensor Flow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research.

The results of this study showed that the developed model achieved an overall accuracy of 96.77% when trained on the whole database containing both original and augmented images. The trained model was tested on each class individually, and the results were compared with other results to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the model.

In conclusion, this study presents a novel approach for detecting plant diseases using deep convolutional neural networks trained on leaf images. The methodology used in this study involves gathering images of plant leaves, assessed by agricultural experts, and using them to train a deep CNN using Tensor Flow. The results of this study showed that the developed model achieved a high level of accuracy and reliability, making it a promising tool for plant disease recognition in practice.
